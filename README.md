Show a reminder if the current site is part of the DKB-Online-Cashback Program
Online-Cashback-Reminder (DKB compatible) shows you an active icon on every page that is part of the DKB Online Cashback program. When you hit the icon on a cashback site a poup will show the cashback amount and a link that opens the DKB Cashback site in a new tab and filters the list for the selected cashback partner site.

Don't lookup shops manually when online shopping, just look at the extension icon and save money without much effort.

No tracking and just minimal access rights save your privacy.
